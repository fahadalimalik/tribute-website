          <h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong> (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25
            December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister, politician and
            the founder of Pakistan.Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India
            Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August
            1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general
            until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam
            ("Great Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His
            birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan. Born at
            Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
            Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he
            enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
            politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose
            to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two
            decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political
            career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the
            1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim
            League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a
            key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
            fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political
            rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however,
            Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a
            campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy. By
            1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
            subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
            marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim
            state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the
            Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
            During the Second World War, the League gained strength while
            leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial
            elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
            reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League
            could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the
            entirety of British India to be united as a single state following
            independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the
            independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a
            Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. As the first governor-general of
            Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and
            policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had
            emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two states'
            independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee
            camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year
            after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left
            a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads
            and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several
            universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.
            According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains
            Pakistan's greatest leader.
